My approach to this project was to first understand the environment I was working with.  Up to this point I've used SQL to do all orderBy 
and the NoSql database concept was quite a culture shock for me.  So I started with sorting.  Last week I read a novel of code and techniqes to get up to speed with Vue.js. The more I read, the more I fell in love with Vue!  It is just awsome.  Next I got involved with setting up a database and all the utilities on my computer.  I spent more time adjusting my computer than on the project I believe.  I reached out to the britecore hiring team and got some ideas last wednesday and decided on VSCode using powershell to mold my modules together. Next! 
Connecting to the database wasn't really a problem for me because I've had alot of experience with back end dev with IBM over the last several years.  The principle guidelines of CRUD are an everyday reality for a developer.
I contined to read and reverse engineer until I resolved the problems at hand.  This too is an everyday reality for a coder.  I love it!
Once I have a problem I cannot quit until it is resolved.  This been said I have an alert that is the Que for the description update in my program and I would have used a model instead.  Also.  I know that with Vue that you can spread the code out into several pages within vue components, but I just left it a one page program.  I'm also learning here.  But I like learning!  I enjoyed the whole process very much!

How long did you spend on the test?  10 days off and on.  Probably a total of 30 hours?  I had to teach myself this new environment or it would have been less

In what ways would you adapt your component so that it could be used in many different scenarios where a data table is required?
Good question.  In this case I just set up each header individually, but in the future I would create an object to contain those headers so it could be easily changed within the export clause.

What CSS property did you recently learn about that helped you on a project?
I learned a little about flex, but I didn't use it in the project.  although I this this would be helpful going forward.

What is your favorite modern Javascript feature?
Definately ES6.  it makes things easier on the developer!

What is your favorite third-party Vue.js library? Why?
Google bootstrap.  They are marketing experts and everything is visually easy to look at
