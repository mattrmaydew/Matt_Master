Front end development work for various projects.  If you have arrived here via Code inspire.  Please help yourself to the source for the vue-shop project in the src folder on the main page. 

Things to look for

 2.  updates for country, state, city dependent dropdowns in the profile section
 3.  Display first and last name in profile admin UI
