My approach to this project was to first understand the environment I was working with.  Up to this point I've used SQL to do all orderBy 
by first hitting a database and returning the order.  The NoSql database concept was quite a culture shock for me and took a little bit of reading to get a grasp on.  I started with sorting.  Last week I read a novel of code and techniqes to get up to speed with Vue.j and the more I read, the more I fell in love with Vue!  It is just awsome. I started with some tutorials to get a feel for the code and I realized as I was developing that the best code was from the Vue.js website.  This will be my primary reference going forward for coding in Vue.js.  You will see that I am using some older code version here from the current vue.js online resources, but it helped me to learn the syntax.  Next I got involved with setting up a database in firebase realtime and all the utilities on my computer.  I spent more time adjusting my computer than on the project I believe LOL.  I reached out to the britecore hiring team and got some ideas last wednesday and decided on the VSCode editor with using powershell to mold my modules together. 

Connecting to the database wasn't really a problem for me because I've had alot of experience with back end develpment with IBM over the last several years.  The principle guidelines of CRUD are an everyday reality for a developer. And I intuitivly was able to step through that process to set up the links.  This too I would do better going forward as the export from the firebase.js could be more refined.
I contined to read and reverse engineer until I resolved the problems at hand.  
This too is an everyday reality for a developer.  I love it!  I love the challenge. Once I have a problem I cannot quit until it is resolved.
This been said I have alot of quick solutions that I would have liked to have done better.  I have an alert for the description update in my program and I would have used a model instead given more time, I'm currently looking for a job and it takes time to do that as well, aslo helping take care of my family, but we all do these things.  Also.  I just left it a one page program for this test with no login and no page tabs.  But I like learning!  I enjoyed the whole process very much!  I want to keep digging and getting better at this and become a great full stack developer.  10 days is how long I've known this and I'm proud of what I've done in that time.

How long did you spend on the test?  10 days off and on.  Probably a total of 30 hours?  I had to teach myself this new environment or it would have been less. 

In what ways would you adapt your component so that it could be used in many different scenarios where a data table is required?
Good question.  In this case I just set up each header individually, but in the future I would create an object to contain those headers so it could be easily changed within the data clause.  I would need to think about how to set up sorting in that case, but I'm sure I could do it!

What CSS property did you recently learn about that helped you on a project?
I learned a little about flex, but I didn't use it in this project.  although I think this would be helpful going forward and learned a little.  There is much you can do with CSS and I have used many differnt properties.  I was wondering if BriteCore has it's own css library?

What is your favorite modern Javascript feature?
Definately ES6.  it makes things easier on the developer!

What is your favorite third-party Vue.js library? Why?
Google bootstrap.  They are marketing experts and everything is visually easy to look at. and works reliably!

Thank you for this opprotunity.  I hope very much that I get a chance to meet the team!  Cheers!
